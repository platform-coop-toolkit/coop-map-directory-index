    <h3>Do you need funding for your cooperative digital project?</h3>
    <p>No matter at which stage of development, potential funders, the International Cooperative Alliance, and
      supportive policymakers need to know that you exist!!</p>

    <p>Whether your project just launched or is already fully operational and growing, prospective supporters need to
      understand the significance of your project!</p>

    <p>They need to grasp that you matter. FOR THAT, THEY NEED DATA!</p>

    <p>We need to provide funders and all supporters with reliable information about your project!! Without it, you may
      be dismissed and remain invisible.</p>

    <p><strong>Please help us to help you.</strong></p>

    <p>The survey has been prepared by Prof. Trebor Scholz and Angela Difede at The New Schoolâ€™s Institute for the
      Cooperative Digital Economy. Please feel free to contact us directly with any questions.</p>

    <p>WE WILL ADD THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE HERE TO A *PUBLIC INDEX* ON HTTP://PLATFORM.COOP</p>
